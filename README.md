# ERTI Notes

- make sure venv is activated
- nbdev_export works
- nbdev_preview works also

### Some usefull tipps:

- Most used:
  - `nbdev_export`
  - `nbdev_test`
  - `nbdev_preview`: Shows live docs (put sometimes update with `nbdev_docs`)
  - `nbdev_docs`
- all CLI commands: https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/cli.html#chelp
- `nbdev_prepare` bundles the following commands:
  - `nbdev_export`: Builds the .py modules from Jupyter notebooks
  - `nbdev_test`: Tests your notebooks
  - `nbdev_clean`: Cleans your notebooks to get rid of extreanous output
    for git
  - `nbdev_readme`: Updates your repo’s README.md file from your index
    notebook.


  
Place this in last cell to autom. execute `nbdev_export` when running
the whole notebook (or this cell)

``` pyton
#| hide
import nbdev; nbdev.nbdev_export()
```

All directives: <https://nbdev.fast.ai/explanations/directives.html>
e.g.  - `#|echo: <true|false>` Toggle the visibility of code-cell
inputs. - `#|output: <true|false|asis>` Setting this to false hides the
output of a cell. Setting this to asis renders the output as raw
markdown.
